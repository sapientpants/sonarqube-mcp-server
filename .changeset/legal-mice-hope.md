Documentation-only changes: Added 9 new ADRs (0020-0028) documenting previously undocumented architectural decisions (testing, code quality, package management, release management, CI/CD, security scanning, circuit breakers, Docker publishing, HTTP transport). Updated 4 existing ADRs (0011, 0016, 0018, 0019) with current implementation details and supersession relationships. Enhanced CLAUDE.md with key architectural decisions summary.
