I’ll compile the findings and provide a structured guide to help you get started.

# SonarQube API Integration in Rust with MCP

## SonarQube Web API Overview

### Authentication Methods
SonarQube’s REST API uses HTTP authentication. The recommended approach is to use a user-generated **authentication token** via Bearer auth. In practice, you generate a token in SonarQube and provide it in the header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>` ([SonarQube Server Web API | Documentation](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-server/10.8/extension-guide/web-api/#:~:text=With%20the%20bearer%20authentication%20scheme%2C,SonarQube%20Server%20token%20is%20used)). This gives the request the same permissions as the user who created the token (for example, the user must have *Browse* permission on a private project to retrieve its data ([SonarQube Server Web API | Documentation](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-server/10.8/extension-guide/web-api/#:~:text=If%2C%20for%20example%2C%20you%20want,Browse%20permission%20on%20this%20project))). Older SonarQube versions also allowed using Basic auth with the token as username (and blank password), but Bearer is now preferred. There is also an **X-Sonar-Passcode** header method (using a system passcode from server config) for specialized cases, but for most integrations the Bearer token is the standard ([SonarQube Server Web API | Documentation](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-server/10.8/extension-guide/web-api/#:~:text=To%20authenticate%20to%20the%20Web,use%20the%20bearer%20authentication%20scheme)).

### Project Scanning via API
Unlike some tools, SonarQube does *not* provide a direct Web API call to perform code analysis on a project. You **cannot trigger a new scan solely via the HTTP API** – SonarQube expects analyses to be run using its scanners (e.g. sonar-scanner CLI or plugins in CI pipelines) and then the results are sent to the server ([Create project and trigger Project analysis using WebAPI - SonarQube Server / Community Build - Sonar Community](https://community.sonarsource.com/t/create-project-and-trigger-project-analysis-using-webapi/108926#:~:text=Colin%20,2024%2C%202%3A06pm%20%204)). In other words, project "scanning" must be done externally (for example, as part of your CI build), and the SonarQube server API is then used to **ingest results or query analysis outcomes**, not to perform the analysis itself. Your Rust integration can therefore invoke a SonarQube scan by calling an external process (like running the scanner) or assume the project is already analyzed, then use the API to retrieve the results.

### Retrieving Metrics and Reports
Once a project has been analyzed, the SonarQube Web API offers endpoints to retrieve metrics, issues, and reports. Key API endpoints include:

- **Code Metrics:** Use the `/api/measures` endpoints to get code metrics (size, complexity, issues counts, etc.). For example, GET `/api/measures/component?component=<projectKey>&metricKeys=ncloc,code_smells,complexity` returns specified metrics (lines of code, code smells, complexity, etc.) for a given project ([SonarQube Server Web API | Documentation](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-server/10.8/extension-guide/web-api/#:~:text=Request)). The response is JSON with the project component and an array of metric values ([SonarQube Server Web API | Documentation](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-server/10.8/extension-guide/web-api/#:~:text=%7B%20,complexity)). You can retrieve multiple metrics in one call by comma-separating `metricKeys`, which is efficient. SonarQube provides many metric keys (listed in *Metric definitions* or via `/api/metrics` endpoint) that you can query ([SonarQube Server Web API | Documentation](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-server/10.8/extension-guide/web-api/#:~:text=You%20can%20retrieve%20code%20metric,endpoint%20to%20retrieve%20them)).

- **Issues (Code Smells/Bugs/Vulnerabilities):** Use the issues search API to retrieve the list of issues (static analysis findings). For example, GET `/api/issues/search?componentKeys=<projectKey>` returns issues for a specific project (with pagination support). This requires the user token to have Browse rights on the project. You can filter by severity, types, etc., to gather specific subsets of issues. This is useful for generating custom reports of bugs or vulnerabilities. (In SonarQube 9.1+, there’s also an `api/projects/export_findings` for exporting all issues in one go for a project branch.)

- **Quality Gate Status:** To get the quality gate result (pass/fail) of the latest analysis, use GET `/api/qualitygates/project_status?projectKey=<projectKey>` ([code analysis - Access quality gate status from sonarqube api - Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27445567/access-quality-gate-status-from-sonarqube-api#:~:text=Since%20SonarQube%205,ID)). This returns a JSON indicating whether the project passed the quality gate and which conditions failed if any. This is often used to enforce standards (e.g. fail a build if the quality gate is not OK).

- **Analysis Reports/History:** The endpoint `/api/project_analyses/search` can list analysis events for a project, including analysis IDs, dates, and labels (like version tags). This gives a high-level summary of each analysis ([How to visualize SonarQube analytics with SquaredUp - SquaredUp](https://squaredup.com/dashboard-gallery/how-to-visualize-sonarqube-analytics-via-web-api/#:~:text=The%20SonarQube%20API%20has%20a,of%20a%20SonarQube%20project%20analysis)). You could retrieve the most recent analysis ID and then fetch details like its quality gate status or specific measures. There’s also `/api/ce/task` to check the status of a Compute Engine task (analysis task) by ID if you need to poll for analysis completion in an integration scenario.

Using these endpoints, you can effectively **handle reports** by pulling the data you need: metrics trends, current metric values, lists of issues, and quality gate outcomes. All responses are JSON, which makes them easy to consume in Rust.

## Rust Libraries for SonarQube API Integration

Integrating with SonarQube’s API in Rust will involve HTTP calls, asynchronous processing, and JSON handling. Below are some of the best libraries to use:

### HTTP Clients (Reqwest vs Hyper)
For making HTTP requests in Rust, **Reqwest** and **Hyper** are two popular choices. **Reqwest** is a high-level HTTP client built on Hyper and Tokio ([HTTP client | WasmEdge Developer Guides](https://wasmedge.org/docs/develop/rust/http_service/client/#:~:text=The%20,example%20in%20WasmEdge%20as%20follows)). It provides a convenient API for common tasks (making GET/POST requests, adding headers, parsing JSON, etc.), which makes it ideal for quickly integrating with REST APIs. In fact, many developers find Reqwest easier to use than raw Hyper ([HTTP client | WasmEdge Developer Guides](https://wasmedge.org/docs/develop/rust/http_service/client/#:~:text=The%20,example%20in%20WasmEdge%20as%20follows)), and it covers 90% of use cases with much less boilerplate.

**Hyper** is a lower-level HTTP library that powers Reqwest under the hood. Hyper gives more fine-grained control and can offer performance benefits in specialized scenarios (e.g., handling a very high number of concurrent connections or streaming bodies), but it’s more complex to use directly. As a rule of thumb, *“Use Reqwest unless it doesn’t support what you absolutely need. Hyper is complicated... Reqwest is a good abstraction to have, when you can afford it.”* ([reqwest vs hyper as http(s) client : r/rust](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/8vc7i2/reqwest_vs_hyper_as_https_client/#:~:text=Use%20Reqwest%20unless%20it%20doesn%27t,support%20what%20you%20absolutely%20need)). In the context of SonarQube integration, Reqwest will likely cover everything needed (HTTPS, basic auth headers, JSON decoding) without the overhead of managing Hyper’s intricacies. 

Other HTTP client libraries exist (e.g., **Surf**, **Actix-web client**, **ureq**). Surf is async-std based, Actix provides an HTTP client integrated with its ecosystem, and ureq is a simple synchronous client. However, **Reqwest** is the most commonly used for async HTTP in Rust and has good compatibility with Tokio.

### Async Runtime (Tokio vs Async-Std)
Since SonarQube API calls are I/O-bound (network requests), using Rust’s async/await is essential for efficiency. The two primary async runtimes are **Tokio** and **async-std**. **Tokio** is the most popular runtime – it’s highly performant, well-maintained, and widely supported by libraries ([Tokio comparison · Issue #992 · async-rs/async-std · GitHub](https://github.com/async-rs/async-std/issues/992#:~:text=As%20for%20%22how%20does%20%60async,is%20for%20you%20to%20decide)). In fact, many asynchronous libraries (including Reqwest, as well as the MCP SDK) are built for Tokio. Using Tokio will ensure compatibility and performance; it has a multithreaded executor and lots of utilities (timers, channels, etc.) if needed.

**async-std** is an alternative with a simpler, `std`-like API. It can be a good choice for certain projects, but it’s less commonly used in large ecosystems and some libraries might not support it out of the box. In practice, **Tokio is recommended in most cases** – it’s the default choice for robust async applications in Rust ([Async for lib crates in mid-2020: Tokio, Async-Std, Smol – which one to choose? - help - The Rust Programming Language Forum](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/async-for-lib-crates-in-mid-2020-tokio-async-std-smol-which-one-to-choose/44661#:~:text=,runtime%2C%20I%20generally%20recommend%20Tokio)). Therefore, for a SonarQube integration (and especially when integrating with MCP which itself likely uses Tokio ([GitHub - Derek-X-Wang/mcp-rust-sdk: Rust SDK for the Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/Derek-X-Wang/mcp-rust-sdk#:~:text=,copy%20serialization%2Fdeserialization))), Tokio is the safest choice for the async runtime.

### Data Processing and JSON Handling
SonarQube’s API returns JSON data, so a key part of the integration is parsing and processing this JSON. The go-to library for this in Rust is **Serde** (with **serde_json**). Serde provides powerful serialization/deserialization facilities. You can define Rust structs that mirror the JSON structure of SonarQube responses and derive `Deserialize` to parse the JSON into those structs seamlessly. For example, the JSON measures response has a structure with a `component` object and a list of `measures` each containing metric keys and values ([SonarQube Server Web API | Documentation](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-server/10.8/extension-guide/web-api/#:~:text=%7B%20,complexity)) – you can map this to Rust structs for type-safe access.

Using Serde is both convenient and performant (it’s widely used in production). If you prefer not to define many structs, you can also use `serde_json::Value` to work with arbitrary JSON, but having strongly-typed data models is a best practice for clarity. For data processing (like computing summaries or filtering issues), you can then use Rust’s standard library (iterators, etc.) or crates like **itertools** for extended iterator functionality. In cases where you might need to output data (say, generate a CSV report of metrics), Rust’s **csv** crate could be handy, or even formatting to Markdown/JSON for the AI to consume.

In summary, **Serde/serde_json** is the essential data handling library here. If you need to manipulate data frames or perform statistical analysis on metrics (less likely in this context), higher-level libraries like **Polars** or **DataFusion** exist, but for most SonarQube metrics (which are just a handful of numbers or issues lists), simple Rust data structures and algorithms will suffice.

## Rust Best Practices for Async API Clients

### Error Handling
Robust error handling is crucial when calling external APIs. In Rust, you should use the `Result<T, E>` type to handle potential failures (network errors, JSON parse errors, etc.) rather than panicking. For a SonarQube client, you might create a custom error enum to encapsulate different error cases (HTTP request failed, invalid response, etc.). The community has converged on two useful crates: **thiserror** and **anyhow** ([thiserror, anyhow, or How I Handle Errors in Rust Apps | Shakacode](https://www.shakacode.com/blog/thiserror-anyhow-or-how-i-handle-errors-in-rust-apps/#:~:text=Ever%20since%20the%20,two%20crates%3A%20thiserror%20and%20anyhow)). 

- **thiserror**: a derive macro for creating your own error types easily. It’s great for library code where you want to define specific error variants and convey detailed error information to the caller ([thiserror, anyhow, or How I Handle Errors in Rust Apps | Shakacode](https://www.shakacode.com/blog/thiserror-anyhow-or-how-i-handle-errors-in-rust-apps/#:~:text=,be%20used%20mainly%20in%20abstractions)) ([thiserror, anyhow, or How I Handle Errors in Rust Apps | Shakacode](https://www.shakacode.com/blog/thiserror-anyhow-or-how-i-handle-errors-in-rust-apps/#:~:text=,it%20to%20the%20logging%20pipeline)). For example, you can define: 

  ```rust
  use thiserror::Error;
  #[derive(Error, Debug)]
  enum SonarError {
      #[error("HTTP request failed: {0}")]
      Http(#[from] reqwest::Error),
      #[error("JSON parsing failed: {0}")]
      Parse(#[from] serde_json::Error),
      #[error("Sonar API error: {0}")]
      Api(String),
  }
  ``` 

  This defines a clear `SonarError` type with variants for different failure scenarios. The `#[from]` attribute automatically converts a `reqwest::Error` or `serde_json::Error` into our `SonarError` (so using the `?` operator will wrap those errors).

- **anyhow**: provides a generic `Error` type for quick and easy error propagation. It’s very useful in application code or prototypes where you just want to bubble up errors without much ceremony. For example, your `main` function can simply return `anyhow::Result<()>`, and you can use the `?` operator everywhere without defining a custom error for each function. This is convenient when the caller doesn’t need to handle different error cases differently ([thiserror, anyhow, or How I Handle Errors in Rust Apps | Shakacode](https://www.shakacode.com/blog/thiserror-anyhow-or-how-i-handle-errors-in-rust-apps/#:~:text=When%20to%20use%20which%3F%20That%27s,I%27ve%20been%20making%20my%20decisions)). In a small Rust tool integrating SonarQube and MCP, using `anyhow` in the top-level application (to log or print errors) and `thiserror` in library modules (to categorize errors) can be a good combination.

Best practice is to **use `Result` and the `?` operator** abundantly to propagate errors up the call stack, and only handle them (e.g., log or convert to user-friendly message) at appropriate boundaries (like when returning a result to the MCP client or to the console). This ensures your code is both robust and concise. In our integration, a SonarQube API call might return `Result<Data, SonarError>` – the error could wrap HTTP issues (like network failure or 401 Unauthorized) or JSON issues (malformed response), etc. The MCP layer could catch those and perhaps send an error response back to the AI client indicating the failure.

### Async Concurrency and Workflows
With async Rust, you want to make sure you fully leverage concurrency to keep the integration fast. Design your workflows to avoid blocking calls. For example, use `reqwest::Client` (which is async) to call SonarQube, and `.await` the futures. If you need to call multiple independent API endpoints (say, fetch metrics and issues at the same time), you can run them concurrently using `tokio::join!` or `futures::join!` to perform parallel requests. This non-blocking concurrency is a big performance win – the program can handle multiple I/O tasks concurrently instead of waiting for each sequentially ([HTTP client | WasmEdge Developer Guides](https://wasmedge.org/docs/develop/rust/http_service/client/#:~:text=note)).

**Do not mix blocking calls** (like std::thread::sleep or performing heavy CPU work) on the async runtime threads. If you have a CPU-bound task (perhaps processing a large result), consider using `tokio::spawn_blocking` or spawn a separate thread so that it doesn’t block the async reactor. However, most JSON processing and moderate data handling can be done directly in async tasks since they are usually fast.

Also, reuse resources like the HTTP client. Creating a `reqwest::Client` is somewhat expensive (it initializes connection pools, etc.), so create it once (e.g., at startup or as a lazy static) and reuse it for all requests. The client will manage keep-alive connections internally. This avoids redoing handshakes for each call.

When designing the async workflow, you may have an async function for each SonarQube API interaction (e.g., `async fn get_metrics(...) -> Result<Metrics, SonarError>`). These can be composed as needed. If an MCP request needs multiple pieces of data, you can `await` them in parallel and then combine results. Using **Tokio’s multi-threaded runtime**, those tasks can even be executed on different threads if they’re truly parallel, increasing throughput.

In summary, use Rust async features to maximize concurrency: issue network requests without waiting for each other when possible, and handle responses as they come. This will make your integration responsive even if the SonarQube server has higher latency.

### Performance Optimizations for API Calls
To optimize performance when interacting with SonarQube’s API, consider the following:

- **Batching Requests:** Where possible, use SonarQube API capabilities to reduce the number of calls. For instance, fetch multiple metrics in one call (as shown by combining metric keys) instead of separate calls for each metric ([SonarQube Server Web API | Documentation](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube-server/10.8/extension-guide/web-api/#:~:text=Request)). Similarly, if you need data for multiple projects, SonarQube’s API might allow querying components in bulk (some endpoints accept multiple component keys). Fewer HTTP round-trips means less overhead.

- **Connection Reuse:** As mentioned, reuse a single HTTP client with keep-alive. This way, multiple requests to the SonarQube server can reuse TCP connections. The Reqwest client by default will pool connections for you.

- **Parallelism:** Utilize concurrency for independent requests. For example, if on startup you want to fetch the latest metrics and issues for a project, do them together rather than sequentially. The latency for both will overlap, reducing total time.

- **Tune the HTTP client if necessary:** For high-throughput scenarios, you might adjust the Reqwest/Hyper client settings (like max connections, timeouts, etc.). In most cases, defaults are fine, but keep it in mind if you scale up usage. Hyper (the lower-level client) can also be considered for maximum throughput or if you need to stream very large responses. But often the bottleneck will be the SonarQube server or network, not the client library.

- **Efficient JSON Processing:** Parse only what you need. If the Sonar response JSON is large but you only need a few fields, define your Serde structs accordingly so that irrelevant fields are skipped. This avoids unnecessary parsing overhead. Serde allows defining partial structs or using `#[serde(skip_deserializing)]` for fields you want to ignore.

- **Asynchronous I/O:** By using async Rust, you already avoid the performance cost of blocking threads. Ensure your integration is fully async top-to-bottom (which it will be if you use Tokio + Reqwest). This lets you handle many requests (if your MCP integration ends up serving multiple simultaneous queries) efficiently.

In practice, a well-written async Rust app using Reqwest and Tokio can handle a large number of SonarQube API calls with minimal latency overhead. Rust’s zero-cost abstractions mean you get close to bare-metal performance. So focus on high-level optimizations like reducing calls and running them in parallel. Also, be mindful of SonarQube’s own limits (rate limits or result size limits); you might need to page through results for very large projects and that could affect how you design the loops (e.g., implement paging with a loop on `api/issues/search` if needed).

## Solution Architecture: Integrating MCP with SonarQube in Rust

### Design Overview and Components
To integrate **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** with SonarQube, we will build a Rust service that acts as an intermediary between an AI (the MCP client) and the SonarQube server. The high-level architecture consists of a few modules/components:

- **MCP Server Module:** Handles communication with the AI assistant using MCP. The Rust program will act as an MCP **server**, meaning it can receive requests (likely JSON-RPC calls defined by the MCP standard) from the AI and return responses. We can leverage an existing MCP Rust SDK (for example, the open-source `mcp-rust-sdk`) to simplify this. The MCP SDK supports transports like WebSockets or STDIO for connecting the AI to our Rust process ([GitHub - Derek-X-Wang/mcp-rust-sdk: Rust SDK for the Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/Derek-X-Wang/mcp-rust-sdk#:~:text=use%20mcp_rust_sdk%3A%3A)). For instance, we could use a WebSocket transport if the AI is connecting over a network, or stdio if the AI launches our tool as a subprocess. The SDK will manage the protocol details, allowing us to focus on implementing the **methods** that the AI can call.

- **SonarQube API Client Module:** Encapsulates SonarQube API interactions. This module will have async functions to call SonarQube endpoints (using Reqwest under the hood). For example, functions like `get_project_metrics(project_key: &str, metrics: &[&str]) -> Result<MetricsReport, SonarError>` or `get_issues(project_key: &str, severity: Option<Severity>) -> Result<Vec<Issue>, SonarError>`. Internally, it will construct the HTTP requests (including authentication header), send them, and parse the JSON into Rust data structures. By isolating this logic, we make it easier to maintain and test (you could unit test these functions by hitting a test Sonar instance or mocking responses).

- **Data Models:** We will define Rust structs to model the data we care about from SonarQube – e.g. a `MetricsReport` struct with fields like `ncloc: u32, complexity: u32, code_smells: u32` (or even a map of metric key to value), an `Issue` struct with fields like `rule, severity, message, file, line`. These will have `Deserialize` derives so we can populate them from SonarQube JSON. This layer makes it easy to work with the data in Rust and to format it for output.

- **Controller/Orchestration Logic:** This ties MCP requests to SonarQube actions. For example, when the MCP server receives a request (say the AI asks, "scan project X for code smells"), the Rust code will map that to calling one or more functions in the SonarQube client module. If the MCP request corresponds to a complex operation (like ensuring a scan is up-to-date and then fetching results), the controller might first run an external scanner or ensure analysis is done, then call the Sonar API. In most cases, we assume the project is already scanned, so the controller simply calls the appropriate SonarQube API client function. The results (Rust structs) are then turned into a response that the MCP client (AI) expects – likely as JSON data or a formatted string.

### Data Flow
1. **MCP Request In:** The AI (MCP client) sends a JSON-RPC request over MCP to our Rust service. For example, a method name could be `"get_project_metrics"` with params like `{ "project": "my_project_key" }`. The MCP Rust SDK receives this and triggers our handler code.

2. **Dispatch to Sonar Client:** Based on the method, our handler (an async function) is called. Within this handler, we invoke the corresponding SonarQube API client function. For instance, `let metrics = sonar_client.get_metrics(project_key, ["ncloc", "code_smells", "bugs"]).await?;`. This call goes out to SonarQube server via HTTP (using the token for auth) and awaits the JSON response. If multiple Sonar calls are needed (maybe one for measures and one for quality gate), we could do them concurrently with `join!`.

3. **Process Results:** Once the SonarQube client returns the data (or an error), the controller can post-process it. This might involve formatting numbers (e.g., converting strings to integers), filtering or sorting issues (if we fetched issues), or combining data (e.g., attach quality gate status to the metrics output). For example, we might merge the metrics and quality gate info into one response object to send back.

4. **MCP Response Out:** Finally, we format the result according to MCP. If using the MCP SDK, we likely just return a value in the handler that the SDK will serialize to a JSON-RPC response. For instance, we might return a `serde_json::Value` or a struct that implements `Serialize`. The MCP protocol will wrap it in a proper response and send it back to the AI. In case of errors (e.g., SonarQube not reachable or project not found), we would return an error through MCP – the SDK may allow throwing exceptions or returning a Result that translates to an MCP error response. We’d make use of our error handling to provide a clear message (e.g., “SonarQube API call failed: <message>”).

### Code Snippets

Below are some illustrative Rust snippets demonstrating key parts of the integration:

**1. Authenticating and calling a SonarQube API (Rust HTTP call):**

```rust
use reqwest::Client;
use serde::Deserialize;

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct MeasuresResponse {
    component: ComponentMeasures
}
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct ComponentMeasures {
    key: String,
    name: String,
    measures: Vec<Measure>
}
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct Measure {
    metric: String,
    value: String,
    #[serde(rename = "bestValue")]
    best_value: Option<bool>
}

// Example: fetch multiple metrics for a project
async fn get_project_metrics(base_url: &str, token: &str, project_key: &str) 
    -> Result<MeasuresResponse, reqwest::Error> 
{
    let url = format!(
        "{}/api/measures/component?component={}&metricKeys=ncloc,complexity,code_smells", 
        base_url, project_key
    );
    let client = Client::new();
    // Send GET request with Bearer auth token
    let response = client
        .get(&url)
        .bearer_auth(token)  // adds Authorization: Bearer <token>
        .send()
        .await?;             // if request fails, reqwest::Error is returned

    // Parse JSON into our MeasuresResponse struct
    let data = response.json::<MeasuresResponse>().await?;
    Ok(data)
}
```

In this snippet, `get_project_metrics` constructs the appropriate URL for SonarQube’s measures API and uses `Client::get` with `.bearer_auth(token)` to set the auth header. The response is awaited and then decoded as JSON into `MeasuresResponse` (thanks to Serde derive on our structs). We return a `Result` with `reqwest::Error` for simplicity here – in a real implementation, we'd likely map that to our own `SonarError` (using `thiserror` as shown earlier).

**2. Handling the result and integrating with MCP:**

```rust
// Pseudocode within an MCP request handler:
async fn handle_get_project_metrics(params: GetMetricsParams) -> Result<MetricsOutput, SonarError> {
    // Call SonarQube API client to get metrics
    let metrics_resp = get_project_metrics(&CONFIG.sonar_base_url, &CONFIG.sonar_token, &params.project_key).await?;
    // Process the data (for example, extract key metrics into a simpler output)
    let mut output = MetricsOutput {
        project: metrics_resp.component.name,
        ncloc: None,
        complexity: None,
        code_smells: None,
    };
    for m in metrics_resp.component.measures {
        match m.metric.as_str() {
            "ncloc" => output.ncloc = m.value.parse().ok(),
            "complexity" => output.complexity = m.value.parse().ok(),
            "code_smells" => output.code_smells = m.value.parse().ok(),
            _ => { /* ignore other metrics */ }
        }
    }
    Ok(output)
}

// When using the MCP SDK's server, you'd register this handler to a method name:
mcp_server.register_method("get_project_metrics", handle_get_project_metrics);
```

Here, `handle_get_project_metrics` is an async function that our MCP server will call when the AI requests the "get_project_metrics" method. It uses the `get_project_metrics` function from our Sonar client module to retrieve data. We then translate the `MeasuresResponse` into a simpler `MetricsOutput` (which could be a struct we define to send only relevant info back). We parse the values from strings to numbers where appropriate. Finally, we return `Ok(output)` or a `SonarError` if something went wrong (which the MCP framework will turn into an error reply). The MCP SDK allows registering this function under a method name so that it’s invoked automatically on requests.

**3. Starting the MCP server (using the MCP Rust SDK):**

```rust
use mcp_rust_sdk::{Server, transport::StdioTransport};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Initialize SonarQube config (e.g., read from env or config file)
    CONFIG.init_from_env();  // pseudo-code for loading base URL and token

    // Create an MCP transport (stdio in this example, could be WebSocket)
    let (transport, _handler) = StdioTransport::new();
    // Create the MCP server with the transport
    let mut server = Server::new(transport);

    // Register RPC methods and their handlers

In this snippet, we initialize an MCP `Server` using a standard I/O transport (which means the server will communicate via stdin/stdout; you could instead use a WebSocketTransport to listen on a port, etc.) ([GitHub - Derek-X-Wang/mcp-rust-sdk: Rust SDK for the Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/Derek-X-Wang/mcp-rust-sdk#:~:text=use%20mcp_rust_sdk%3A%3A)). We then register a method "get_project_metrics" and provide a closure or handler for it. Here, we parse the incoming JSON params to our `GetMetricsParams` struct (which might contain the project key and list of metrics requested). We then call our earlier `handle_get_project_metrics` and map the result: on success, serialize the `MetricsOutput` to JSON Value to send back; on error, propagate the error (which the MCP SDK will handle as an error response). Finally, we start the server event loop. This means the program will wait for incoming MCP requests, handle them with our async function, and respond over the chosen transport.

### Considerations
- **Configuration:** The SonarQube server URL and the authentication token should be configurable (environment variables or config file). The Rust program can load these at startup (here referenced via `CONFIG`).
- **Security:** Ensure the token is kept secure (don’t log it). When integrating with MCP, you might also restrict what methods are exposed for safety.
- **Error Propagation:** The integration should catch errors from SonarQube API calls and return a meaningful error over MCP. For instance, if authentication fails (HTTP 401), the Rust code could detect that and return an MCP error like "Authentication to SonarQube failed, please check token."
- **Performance:** If the AI makes frequent requests, our Rust service can handle them concurrently (thanks to async). We should also possibly implement caching if appropriate – for example, if an analysis result doesn’t change frequently, we might cache the last metrics for a project for a short time to avoid hitting the SonarQube API repeatedly in a short span. This cache could simply be in-memory with a timestamp.
- **Extensibility:** We can add more MCP methods as needed, such as "get_issues", "get_quality_gate", etc., each calling the respective SonarQube API and returning data. The modular design (separating the Sonar client and MCP interface) makes it easy to grow.

By following this architecture, we create a clear separation of concerns: the **MCP layer** deals with the AI protocol and input/output format, while the **SonarQube layer** deals with fetching and preparing the data. Rust’s async and the robust libraries (Tokio, Reqwest, Serde) ensure that this integration will be efficient and maintainable. This allows an AI assistant to query code quality metrics or scan results from SonarQube on demand, enabling intelligent insights about code directly through the MCP channel.
