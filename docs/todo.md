# DeepSource Issues Todo List

## Documentation Issues (RS-D1001: Undocumented public item in source code)

These issues are about missing documentation for public items in the codebase. All public items should be documented to improve code clarity and help other developers understand and use the code.

## Other Issues

### Bug Risk Issues
- [ ] tests/end_to_end_tests.rs:40 - RS-E1021: Called `mem::forget` or `mem::drop` on a non-Drop type

### Anti-Pattern Issues
- [ ] src/mcp/sonarqube/client.rs:116 - RS-R1000: Function with cyclomatic complexity higher than threshold
- [ ] tests/end_to_end_tests.rs:162 - RS-W1079: Empty call to `new()`
- [ ] src/main.rs:86 - RS-W1079: Empty call to `new()`

## Progress Tracking
- Total issues: 84
- Fixed issues: 18
- Remaining issues: 66

## Notes
- Most issues are documentation-related.
- Priority should be given to fixing the Bug Risk and Anti-Pattern issues after documentation is completed.
- For documentation, start with the most critical and commonly used structures and modules.
