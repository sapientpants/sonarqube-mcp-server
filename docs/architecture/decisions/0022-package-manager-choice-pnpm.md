# 22. Package Manager Choice pnpm

Date: 2025-10-11

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The choice of package manager significantly impacts development workflow, CI/CD performance, disk usage, and dependency management reliability. The SonarQube MCP Server requires:

- Fast dependency installation for rapid development iteration
- Efficient disk space usage across multiple projects
- Strict dependency resolution to prevent phantom dependencies
- Reliable dependency management in CI/CD pipelines
- Support for standalone distribution (no global installation required)
- Consistent versions across development and CI/CD environments

Traditional npm has several limitations:

- Flat node_modules structure can lead to phantom dependencies (accessing packages not in package.json)
- Slower installation times due to redundant copies of packages
- Higher disk space usage with duplicate packages across projects
- Less strict dependency resolution

Yarn Classic improved some aspects but still uses flat node_modules and has its own consistency issues. Yarn Berry (v2+) introduced significant breaking changes and has lower adoption.

## Decision

We will use **pnpm** (version 10.17.0) as the exclusive package manager for this project.

### Key Features of pnpm

1. **Content-Addressable Storage**
   - All packages stored once in a global store (~/.pnpm-store)
   - node_modules uses hard links to the global store
   - Dramatically reduces disk space usage (up to 50% compared to npm)

2. **Strict Dependency Resolution**
   - Non-flat node_modules structure prevents phantom dependencies
   - Only dependencies declared in package.json are accessible
   - Catches undeclared dependencies early in development

3. **Performance**
   - Up to 2x faster than npm for clean installs
   - Parallel installation of packages
   - Efficient caching and reuse

4. **Standalone Distribution**
   - Can run as standalone binary without global installation
   - Ensures consistent pnpm version across all environments
   - Configured via `packageManager` field in package.json

### Version Consistency Requirement

**CRITICAL**: The pnpm version must be consistent across ALL locations:

1. **package.json**: `"packageManager": "pnpm@10.17.0"`
2. **Dockerfile**: `RUN npm install -g pnpm@10.17.0`
3. **GitHub Actions workflows**: All workflow files using pnpm must specify `version: 10.17.0`
   - `.github/workflows/main.yml`
   - `.github/workflows/pr.yml`
   - `.github/workflows/publish.yml` (PNPM_VERSION environment variable)
   - `.github/workflows/reusable-setup.yml` (default pnpm-version input)
   - `.github/workflows/reusable-security.yml` (default pnpm-version input)
   - `.github/workflows/reusable-validate.yml` (default pnpm-version input)
4. **Documentation**: README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md
5. **Setup scripts**: `scripts/setup.sh`

**Why this matters**: If package.json and GitHub workflows have different pnpm versions, CI/CD fails with:

```
Error: Multiple versions of pnpm specified:
  - version X in the GitHub Action config with the key "version"
  - version pnpm@Y in the package.json with the key "packageManager"
```

### Configuration

**package.json**:

```json
{
  "packageManager": "pnpm@10.17.0"
}
```

This field:

- Enables Corepack to automatically use the correct pnpm version
- Ensures all developers and CI/CD use the same version
- Prevents version drift and inconsistent behavior

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Disk Space Efficiency**: Saves 50%+ disk space compared to npm through global store
- **Faster Installs**: 2x faster clean installs, even faster with warm cache
- **Phantom Dependency Prevention**: Strict node_modules structure catches undeclared dependencies
- **Better Monorepo Support**: Built-in workspace support (though not needed for this project)
- **Consistent Environments**: `packageManager` field ensures version consistency
- **Standalone Distribution**: No global pnpm installation needed with Corepack
- **Better CI/CD Performance**: Faster installs reduce pipeline execution time
- **Symlink-based Structure**: Easy to understand dependency tree
- **Lock File Determinism**: pnpm-lock.yaml is more deterministic than package-lock.json

### Negative

- **Learning Curve**: Team members familiar with npm/yarn need to learn pnpm commands
- **Ecosystem Compatibility**: Some older tools may not recognize pnpm's node_modules structure
- **Version Management Overhead**: Must update version in multiple locations (mitigated by documentation in CLAUDE.md)
- **IDE Integration**: Some IDEs may not fully support pnpm's symlink structure (rare)
- **Docker Image Size**: Requires installing pnpm in container (minimal overhead)

### Neutral

- **Different Commands**: Some npm/yarn commands have different syntax in pnpm
- **Lock File Format**: pnpm-lock.yaml differs from package-lock.json or yarn.lock
- **Global Store Location**: Requires understanding of ~/.pnpm-store for troubleshooting
- **Corepack Dependency**: Relies on Node.js Corepack (experimental until Node 16.9+)

## Implementation

### Installation

**With Corepack (recommended)**:

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@10.17.0 --activate
```

**Direct installation**:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm@10.17.0
```

### Common Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Install with frozen lockfile (CI/CD)
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# Add a dependency
pnpm add <package>

# Add a dev dependency
pnpm add -D <package>

# Remove a dependency
pnpm remove <package>

# Run a script
pnpm run <script>
pnpm <script>  # Short form

# Update dependencies
pnpm update

# Audit dependencies
pnpm audit
```

### CI/CD Integration

**GitHub Actions**:

```yaml
- name: Install pnpm
  uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4
  with:
    version: 10.17.0
    run_install: false
    standalone: true

- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: 22
    cache: pnpm

- name: Install dependencies
  run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

**Dockerfile**:

```dockerfile
# Install pnpm globally
RUN npm install -g pnpm@10.17.0

# Install dependencies
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --prod
```

### Migration from npm

If migrating from npm:

1. Delete `package-lock.json` and `node_modules`
2. Add `"packageManager": "pnpm@10.17.0"` to package.json
3. Run `pnpm install` to generate `pnpm-lock.yaml`
4. Update all CI/CD workflows to use pnpm
5. Update documentation and developer setup instructions
6. Commit `pnpm-lock.yaml` to version control

## Examples

### Before (with npm)

**Phantom dependency issue**:

```typescript
// lodash not in package.json, but accessible via transitive dependency
import _ from 'lodash'; // Works with npm, but fragile

// If the transitive dependency removes lodash, this breaks
```

**Disk space**:

```bash
project-1/node_modules/lodash  # 1.2 MB
project-2/node_modules/lodash  # 1.2 MB
project-3/node_modules/lodash  # 1.2 MB
Total: 3.6 MB for 3 projects
```

### After (with pnpm)

**Phantom dependency prevention**:

```typescript
// lodash not in package.json
import _ from 'lodash'; // Error: Cannot find module 'lodash'

// Forces explicit declaration in package.json
// Results in more reliable dependency management
```

**Disk space**:

```bash
~/.pnpm-store/lodash@4.17.21  # 1.2 MB (stored once)
project-1/node_modules/lodash  # symlink (few bytes)
project-2/node_modules/lodash  # symlink (few bytes)
project-3/node_modules/lodash  # symlink (few bytes)
Total: ~1.2 MB for 3 projects (70% savings)
```
