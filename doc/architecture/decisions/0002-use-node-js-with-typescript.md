# 2. Use Node.js with TypeScript

Date: 2025-06-13

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The SonarQube MCP server needs to be implemented in a technology stack that provides:
- Strong type safety to prevent runtime errors
- Rich ecosystem for HTTP clients and server frameworks
- Easy distribution mechanism for end users
- Good developer experience with modern tooling
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Quick feedback loop during development

Alternative languages like Rust were considered but would introduce longer compilation times and a steeper learning curve.

## Decision

We will implement the server using Node.js with TypeScript, managed by pnpm.

Key aspects of this decision:
- **Runtime**: Node.js provides a stable, well-supported JavaScript runtime
- **Language**: TypeScript adds static typing, improving code reliability and developer experience
- **Package Manager**: pnpm for efficient dependency management
- **Distribution**: npm/npx for easy installation and execution by end users

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Quick Feedback Loop**: Fast compilation and hot-reloading enable rapid development iterations compared to compiled languages like Rust
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript's static typing catches errors at compile time, reducing runtime bugs
- **Developer Experience**: Modern IDE support, auto-completion, and refactoring tools
- **Ecosystem**: Access to npm's vast collection of packages for HTTP clients, testing, and utilities
- **Distribution**: Users can easily install and run the server via `npx @burgess01/sonarqube-mcp-server`
- **Community**: Large community support for both Node.js and TypeScript
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux without modification

### Negative

- **Build Step**: TypeScript requires compilation to JavaScript before execution
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need familiarity with TypeScript's type system
- **Bundle Size**: TypeScript adds some overhead compared to plain JavaScript

### Neutral

- **Performance**: Node.js provides adequate performance for an MCP server that primarily makes HTTP requests
- **Maintenance**: Regular updates needed for Node.js, TypeScript, and dependencies
