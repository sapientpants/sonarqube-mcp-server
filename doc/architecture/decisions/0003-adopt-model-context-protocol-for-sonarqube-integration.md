# 3. Adopt Model Context Protocol for SonarQube Integration

Date: 2025-06-13

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to integrate SonarQube's code quality and security analysis capabilities with AI assistants like Claude. This integration should allow AI clients to programmatically access SonarQube data and perform operations through a standardized interface.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging as a standard protocol for AI assistants to interact with external tools and data sources. It provides:
- A standardized way to expose tools to AI assistants
- Built-in support for bidirectional communication
- A growing ecosystem of compatible AI clients
- SDKs that simplify server implementation

## Decision

We will adopt the Model Context Protocol (MCP) framework as the foundation for our SonarQube integration. Specifically:

1. The application will be designed as an MCP server using the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` package
2. The MCP server (implemented in `index.ts`) will register a comprehensive suite of SonarQube tools
3. We will use the Stdio transport for communication between the MCP server and AI clients
4. Each SonarQube operation will be exposed as a distinct MCP tool with proper input validation and error handling

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Standardization**: Using MCP ensures compatibility with any AI client that supports the protocol, not just Claude
- **Simplified Integration**: AI clients can discover and use SonarQube tools without custom integration code
- **Tool Discovery**: MCP's tool registration system allows AI clients to automatically discover available SonarQube operations
- **Type Safety**: The MCP SDK provides TypeScript support for defining tool inputs and outputs
- **Future-Proof**: As MCP evolves and gains adoption, our integration will benefit from ecosystem improvements

### Negative Consequences

- **Protocol Dependency**: We're tied to the MCP specification and any breaking changes it might introduce
- **Limited Transport Options**: While Stdio transport works well for local integrations, it may not be suitable for all deployment scenarios
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand MCP concepts and patterns to maintain the integration
- **Debugging Complexity**: Troubleshooting issues requires understanding both SonarQube API and MCP protocol layers

### Mitigation Strategies

- Abstract the transport layer to allow future support for HTTP or WebSocket transports if needed
- Maintain comprehensive documentation for MCP-specific implementation details
- Implement robust error handling and logging to aid in debugging MCP communication issues
- Monitor MCP protocol evolution and plan for version upgrades
