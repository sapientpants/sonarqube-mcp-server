# Refactoring Summary

## Completed Refactoring Tasks

### API Module (api.ts)
1. ✅ **Renamed generic type alias**: Changed `ParamRecord` to `QueryParameters` for better clarity
2. ✅ **Removed redundant wrapper functions**: Eliminated `apiGet` and `apiPost` functions that were just delegating to `defaultHttpClient`

### SonarQube Client (sonarqube.ts)
1. ✅ **Extracted parameter transformation helper**: Created `arrayToCommaSeparated` function to eliminate code duplication
2. ✅ **Extracted API URL constant**: Replaced magic string 'https://sonarcloud.io' with `DEFAULT_SONARQUBE_URL` constant
3. ✅ **Improved error handling**: Added proper error logging in `getSourceCode` method
4. ✅ **Removed dead code**: Eliminated duplicate `SonarQubeApiComponent` interface

## Commits Made
- `refactor: rename ParamRecord to QueryParameters for better clarity`
- `refactor: remove redundant apiGet and apiPost wrapper functions`
- `refactor: extract arrayToCommaSeparated helper function`
- `refactor: extract DEFAULT_SONARQUBE_URL constant`
- `refactor: improve error handling in getSourceCode method`
- `refactor: remove duplicate SonarQubeApiComponent interface`

## Remaining Opportunities

### Type Organization
The sonarqube.ts file still contains many interfaces that could be organized into separate type files by domain (projects, issues, measures, etc.)

### Index.ts Modularization
The index.ts file remains large with multiple responsibilities that could be split into:
- handlers.ts
- lambdas.ts
- tools.ts
- server.ts

### Additional Improvements
- Create a generic handler factory to reduce code duplication
- Extract common transformation patterns
- Improve type safety by reducing type assertions

These larger refactoring tasks would require more extensive changes and careful testing to ensure no functionality is broken.
